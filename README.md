# appak's github pages page
just a funky website. here are the pages / things:
- projects I like and want to "archive" (copy and steal for later)
- flash games (ruffle)
- a chatroom I copied so I can chat with friends I guess
- cool stuff
- toki pona dictionary (thanks zrajm)
- amen break samples to make breakcore :)

created only bc I was bored of stealing other stuff in their own repo :skull: (I also need to know more html and css I guess, idk)


## TO DO

- some tools maybe
- more funny games I want to poke around in
- learn some more css and web development
- more pages :)
- get eggs

## wanna talk to me abt something? you can contact me on these sites (ranked in order of "yea lol I'll check this")
