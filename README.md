# appak's github pages page
just a funky website. here are the pages / things:
- projects I like and want to "archive" (copy and steal for later)
- flash games (ruffle)
- a chatroom I copied so I can chat with friends I guess
- cool stuff
- toki pona dictionary (thanks zrajm)
- amen break samples to make breakcore :)

created only bc I was bored of stealing other stuff in their own repo :skull: (I also need to know more html and css I guess, idk)
